//! Context creation configuration
//!
//! A [`Conf`](struct.Conf.html) struct is used to descrbe a hardware and platform specific setup,
//! mostly video display settings.
//!
//! ## High DPI rendering
//!
//! You can set the [`Conf::high_dpi`](struct.Conf.html#structfield.high_dpi) flag during initialization to request
//! a full-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays. The default behaviour
//! is `high_dpi = false`, this means that the application will
//! render to a lower-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays and the
//! rendered content will be upscaled by the window system composer.
//! In a HighDPI scenario, you still request the same window size during
//! [`oxid::start`](../fn.start.html), but the framebuffer sizes returned by [`Context::screen_size`](../graphics/struct.Context.html#method.screen_size)
//! will be scaled up according to the DPI scaling ratio.
//! You can also get a DPI scaling factor with the function
//! [`Context::dpi_scale`](../graphics/struct.Context.html#method.dpi_scale).
//! Here's an example on a Mac with Retina display:
//! ```ignore
//! Conf {
//!   width = 640,
//!   height = 480,
//!   high_dpi = true,
//!   .. Default::default()
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! The functions [`screen_size`](../graphics/struct.Context.html#method.screen_size) and [`dpi_scale`](../graphics/struct.Context.html#method.dpi_scale) will
//! return the following values:
//! ```bash
//! screen_size -> (1280, 960)
//! dpi_scale   -> 2.0
//! ```
//!
//! If the high_dpi flag is false, or you're not running on a Retina display,
//! the values would be:
//! ```bash
//! screen_size -> (640, 480)
//! dpi_scale   -> 1.0
//! ```
